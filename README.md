# backendquickbuck

This is the backend of my first full stack application that can be found here [here](https://overflow68.github.io/quickbuck/#/).

It allows the user to do the following:

1. Create an account
2. Create Listings ( See [this](https://github.com/overflow68/quickbuck) repo for a brief explanation about the project.)
3. CRUD operations on your own listings
4. Contact Vendors
5. Browse Listings
